# **Used Car Price Prediction**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting the resale price of used cars using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze various car attributes and build a predictive model that estimates the price accurately. The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

## **Problem Statement**

Used car prices depend on multiple factors such as brand, age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history. Manually estimating prices can be inaccurate and inconsistent. This project aims to build a data-driven model that predicts used car prices based on historical data.

---

## **Approach**

* Collected and loaded used car data
* Performed data cleaning and handled missing values
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features
* Applied feature engineering and data preprocessing
* Trained multiple regression models
* Compared model performance and selected the best-performing model

---

## **Technologies Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## **Machine Learning Models**

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* XGBoost Regressor

---

## **Results**

The model was able to predict used car prices with good accuracy. Ensemble models such as Random Forest and XGBoost performed better than basic linear regression due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

## **Role & Contribution**

I worked on the project end-to-end, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.

---

## **How to Run the Project**

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file
3. Install required libraries
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially

---

## **Future Improvements**

* Use larger and more diverse datasets
* Add a web interface for price prediction
* Improve accuracy with advanced feature engineering
